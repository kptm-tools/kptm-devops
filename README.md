# 🚀 DevOps Infrastructure Repository

Welcome to the **DevOps Infrastructure Repository**! This repository contains all Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) for deploying and managing the Kubernetes-based environment that supports our microservices.  

## 📦 Repository Overview

This repository is used to store and manage the infrastructure code for deploying and maintaining Kubernetes clusters, as well as other essential infrastructure components required for our SaaS platform.

### 🛠️ Key Components
- **Kubernetes Manifests**: Configuration files for deploying, updating, and managing microservices on the Kubernetes cluster.
- **Helm Charts**: Preconfigured charts for streamlined Kubernetes deployments.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: GitHub Actions workflows to automate build, test, and deployment of infrastructure changes.
- **Secrets Management**: Secure storage of sensitive data using tools like HashiCorp Vault or Kubernetes Secrets.

```

## 🌟 Features
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** for consistent and reproducible deployments.
- Automated **CI/CD pipelines** for rapid and reliable releases.
- Centralized configuration management using **Kubernetes and Helm**.

## 🛡️ Security Practices
- Follow **least privilege principles** for cloud and Kubernetes roles.
- Use **GitHub Secrets** to securely manage sensitive data in CI/CD workflows.
- Implement **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)** in Kubernetes to manage access.
- Encrypt sensitive data using **Kubernetes Secrets** or **HashiCorp Vault**.

## 🔄 Continuous Integration & Deployment
This repository leverages **GitHub Actions** for continuous integration and deployment workflows. Below are the key workflows:

1. **Infrastructure Linting**: Ensure that Kubernetes and Terraform files are error-free and follow best practices.
2. **Infrastructure Deployment**: Automate deployment of changes to Kubernetes clusters.
3. **Secret Management**: Safely inject secrets during the deployment process.
4. **Rollback Mechanisms**: Automated rollback for failed deployments.

## 🗂️ Environments

We manage multiple environments within our infrastructure:

- **Development**: Rapid iteration and testing.
- **Staging**: Pre-production testing with production-like settings.
- **Production**: Live environment for end users.

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

To deploy the infrastructure using this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kptm-devops.git
   cd kptm-devops
   ```

2. **Set up Kubernetes Context**:
   
   Make sure you have access to the Kubernetes cluster and set the correct context:
   
   ```bash
   kubectl config use-context <your-cluster-context>
   ```

3. **Apply Changes**:
   
   Apply Kubernetes manifests:
   
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f k8s/
   ```

4. **Helm Deployment**:
   
   Use Helm for deploying charts:
   
   ```bash
   helm install <release-name> helm/<chart-directory>
   ```
